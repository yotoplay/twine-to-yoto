SFX: Footsteps walking down an echoey corridor.
ROHAN
(quietly)
We’re really doing this. We’re going to Lumera Operations – whatever that is. We’re actually going to find Mr Boyd. 
ZORA
(quietly)
We hope.
(sharp intake of breath)
I’m so nervous...
A moment. 
ROHAN
(quietly)
Me too.
OLLIE
(Shouting from a distance)
Hey Zora, Rohan!
JANE
(Shouting from a distance)
We’ll leave you to it –
ROHAN
(quietly)
No, don’t. Stay Jane.
ZORA
(laughs under her breath)
JANE
(Shouting from a distance)
You’ve got this!
ROHAN
(Suddenly confident)
Yeah! We know! 
ZORA
(unsure)
Do we know...? 
ROHAN
Good luck on your mission, guys! Come on Zora – there’s the door.
(with wonder)
Operations!
ZORA
I can see it, Rohan. I have eyes.  
SFX: Rummaging in pocket.
ZORA
We’re going in, okay? This is it.
ROHAN
(deep breath)
This is it. 
SFX: Bleep bleep boop door opening sounds.
SFX: Sound is now not echoey at all, it feels furnished and plush. Shoes rubbing on the carpet.
ROHAN
Ooh this carpet’s nice! Thick!
ALICE
(corporate voice)
Welcome to Lumera Operations.
ROHAN
(muttering under breath)
Oh no, not her again.
SFX: Mischievous ALICE trill.
ZORA
(deep breath)
Okay, Rohan, let’s not look down at the carpet – look up, around you. There’s two doors here. That small one on the left–
ROHAN
And that huge, tall, metal one on the right. That’s the one. We’re trying that one first!

SFX: Hands slapping a metal door.
ROHAN
Hello? Anyone in there?
SFX: Hands slapping a metal door.
ZORA
I don’t think that’s going to work. Look there’s a key pad.
(concentrating)
And those symbols next to it. Are they random? What do they mean? 
SFX: Buttons being pressed, then an error sounds.
ZORA
Rohan! Don’t! Don’t touch anything! You might be making it worse. What if it’s like a phone and now it’s...it’s even more locked!
ROHAN
(frustrated)
Gah, yeah, you’re right.
A beat.
SFX: A button being pressed.
ZORA
(shouting)
Rohan, I said stop! You’re just like my little brother.
ROHAN
Okay, I hear you Zora – loud and clear. 
ZORA
Sorry for shouting, but this door’s important –
ROHAN
Absolutely.
ZORA
– so we have to really think about how to get in.
(sighs)
We’ll probably have to explore Lumera Operations properly first.
ROHAN
(sighing)
You’re right. Otherwise this, this...game we find ourselves in would be way too easy.
ZORA
If only this was a game...
ROHAN
Yeah, I’d cheat and go straight to the end. 
ZORA
Again, just like my little brother...
A beat.
SFX: Banging on the door again
ROHAN
Mr Boyd! If you’re in there, give us a sign!
ZORA
(quietly)
Please.
MR BOYD
(very quietly, in the distance)
Spy Club, Strike!
ROHAN
(shocked)
D-did you hear that? That was Mr Boyd, wasn’t it? Tell me you heard him? That wasn’t just in my head, was it?
ZORA
(quietly)
No. No, it wasn’t. Also – how would he know ‘Spy Club, Strike?’ Jane literally just came up with that phrase.
(panicked)
He must be in there!
(louder now)
Mr Boyd, we don’t know what’s going on –
ROHAN
But we’re gonna get you out. Stay safe in there, okay?
ZORA
If you can. Right, Rohan. The little door it is. 
SFX: Footsteps

:: 20100 [narrative-complete assets-complete] {"position":"600,200","size":"100,100"}
SFX: Cheesy Corporate Video music playing quietly, it get’s increasingly louder as the kids approach the door. 
ZORA
What is that?
ROHAN
It’s a bop, is what that is.
ZORA
(slightly laughing)
Be serious, Rohan. 
ROHAN
I am. Deadly serious. Someone should sample it real quick. Shall we go in, and check it out?
ZORA
Yeah. Let’s. 
SFX: Pulling door open, over carpet. 
ROHAN
Ooh, grab your popcorn, Zora – it’s a tiny cinema!
ZORA
But what’s the movie?
SFX: Projector starting up sound to match the gif. Music trills or does something dramatic to signal it’s really about to start. From here, most of the rest of this is the corporate video – except where Rohan and Zora talk over it. 
NATALIA
In a world where intelligence is of utmost importance, Lumera protects what matters most. Welcome to the team. I’m Natalia Archer, CEO. 
ROHAN
(enthusiastically)
Delighted to be here, Nat Nat!
ZORA
(hissing)
Rohan! Listen! No talking!
NATALIA
Since 1972, Lumera has been leading on high-tech espionage solutions, blending human expertise with advanced technology to secure the world. From covert surveillance to digital forensics, we stay ahead of the curve – so our clients don’t have to.
ZORA
(amazed)
Oh! This is a real life Spy Club!
ROHAN
(sarcastically)
Shush! Let Natalia talk!
(now excited)
But, oh my gosh it is!
NATALIA
Our clients, based in almost one hundred countries across the world, include global leaders in defence, cybersecurity, and intelligence agencies. We also undertake... independent projects.
ZORA
(confused, under her breath)
Independent projects?
NATALIA
At Lumera, every one of our team members plays a crucial role. You’ll be working on the frontlines of innovation, developing cutting-edge solutions to the world’s toughest challenges. Let’s hear from one of your colleagues.
MR BOYD
(trying to hide his normal accent a little bit)
We foster a culture of excellence, creativity, and integrity at Lumera. 
ROHAN
No, wait! That sounds just like Mr Boyd.
ZORA
A bit – but it looks nothing like him!
MR BOYD
Our people – fifty and counting – are our greatest asset. Lumera will invest in your growth and provide opportunities to lead and innovate. 
NATALIA
So, once again, welcome to Lumera. Together, we’ll make the impossible, possible.
SFX: Cheesy Corporate music ends with a dramatic flourish.
SFX: Projector powering down. The tinkling of overhead fluorescent lights coming on. 
ROHAN
So that was interesting. Lumera’s a spy agency? Look at us! Can you believe we’re here?
ZORA
Honestly, I can’t. 
A beat.
Do you think that was Mr Boyd speaking? Is he actually a spy?
ROHAN
Maybe – it sure sounded like him to me.
ZORA
Yeah. Me too. 
ROHAN
So, it’s either one of two things. Mr Boyd works here, as a secret agent – or, OR – he’s sent us here because he’s in real trouble? Is he a target? 
(conspiratorial)
Ooh – maybe Mrs Barrett’s target? She definitely doesn’t like him, and we’re not sure why?
ZORA
I don’t know which option would be better – both are bad.
(deep breath)
Let’s look around. Let’s figure this thing out. 
SFX: Rattling door handle.
ZORA
The door we came in is locked, Rohan!
ROHAN
(from a slight distance)
There’s another door over here, don’t worry – we’ll go this way.
SFX: Rattling door handle.
ROHAN
Welp, maybe not. 
ZORA
We’re locked in!
SFX: ALICE chiming in.
ROHAN
(sarcastically)
Great.
ALICE
Hello, Zora. Hello...you.
ROHAN
Alice! It’s been a while. 
ALICE
No it hasn’t. It’s been... nine minutes and forty six seconds since we last made contact.
ROHAN
It was a joke.
A beat.
ALICE
But jokes are supposed to be funny, aren’t they? It doesn’t compute...
ZORA
Alice – we’re trying to get out, but the doors are locked.
ALICE
I know! I locked them!
ROHAN
Whyyyyy?
ALICE
Because diagnostics are fun, remember? 
SFX: Powering up sound. 
Let’s see if you were really listening to the Lumera story.

Correct.

Okay, run it back, Alice! This remix is fire.
ALICE
It’s not fire – there’s nothing elemental about it. Ah, here we are. 
NATALIA
Since 1972...
SFX: Echo/remixing on ‘1972’?
ZORA
See? 
ALICE
I’m fully charged, and operating optimally, so I’ll give you a another chance.
ZORA
Thanks, Alice.

Yeah, very generous.

There’s no way Jane and Ollie are in trouble! They can’t be.
ZORA
(quietly)
They might be.
ROHAN
(dramatically)
How can you say that, Zora!?
ZORA
I don’t want them to be, obviously! But I just don’t know.
ROHAN
No, no – Jane is too strong, too smart, too...
ZORA
(laughing)
Too superb? Rohan, you’re obsessed with Jane.
ROHAN
Obsessed? Moi? No. I just care!
ZORA
Of course you do. Then worry about Ollie too – and us.  
ROHAN
I do! I care about everyone, everywhere. You know, empathy’s a skill, Zora. You have to work on it. 
ZORA
If you say so.
ROHAN
(Mimicking Natalia Archer)
In a world where intelligence is of utmost importance, Rohan protects what matters most. People.

No! No! Don’t!

Oh no! Mr Boyd!
ZORA
That’s definitely him! Rohan – we have to pick up the pace.

There’s the door!

:: 20300 [assets-complete narrative-complete] {"position":"925,200","size":"100,100"}
SFX: Clicking, clacking, beeping, reams of paper being printed. This is a data room.
ROHAN
What’s all this?
SFX: Flicking a piece of paper.
ROHAN
There’s just loads of numbers. Endless numbers, sketches and screens. 
(wailing slightly)
What does it all mean?
ZORA
Hmmm...this is a data room, I think.
ROHAN
A data room? A whole room for data?
ZORA
(sighs)
Yes. Lumera is an intelligence agency, right?
ROHAN
Natalia said so, so yep. I believe her – she looks like you can trust her. Her confidence, I can tell.
ZORA
Okay...so this must be the place – or one of the places – they receive information.
(wowed and impressed)
All this...knowledge, so much intel. All in code.
ROHAN
(smiling)
You like?
ZORA
I love. Let me take a look.
SFX: Picking up some paper.
ZORA
Hmmm.
ROHAN
Hmmm?
ZORA
Look at this? This is a blue print, right?
ROHAN
If you say so. It looks like a sketch of some construction site.
ZORA
So a blueprint. The definition of a blueprint. 
A beat. 
(gasp)
Wait. This is Fleming High!
ROHAN
Is it? How can you tell?
ZORA
Well...
SFX: Jabbing at or smoothing a piece of paper.
ZORA
Look – that drawing looks a lot like our school. 
ROHAN
It does?
ZORA
Yeah – there’s the car park. That would be Mr Boyd’s classroom and there – that’s the construction site. Ah, it’s definitely Fleming High! It says ‘zero two one two eight one’ on it! I knew it!
ROHAN
So?
ZORA
So? That’s our school’s code – it’s on all of our IDs.
SFX: Rifling in her pocket.
ZORA
See? You’ve never noticed that?
ROHAN
Nope. I don’t look at my ID. Ever. The ‘photographer’ captured my bad side, and wouldn’t do a retake. So mean. I wish him nothing but bad luck. May he always have spinach in his teeth. 
ZORA
That’s kind of you. 
(to herself, mostly)
Okay – so we have a blueprint for the work happening at school. Why? Why does Lumera care?
SFX: Picking up bits of paper.
ZORA
Okay, another zero two one two eight one piece of intel!
ROHAN
What does this one say?
ZORA
It’s a note – or part of one. It says ‘021281: Increased server capacity? Aiden?’
ROHAN
Aiden? Not my Aiden, surely? What’s my favourite little life-draining robot got to do with this?
SFX: Angry ALICE trill.
ROHAN
I take it back, Alice, you’re my one and only.
SFX: Satisfied ALICE trill.
ZORA
I don’t know how Aiden’s involved – but I need to find out.
(takes a breath)
I’m going to log into the computer. 
ROHAN
Yes, hack that mainframe, Zora! Let’s go!
SFX: Clicking of mouse
ZORA
Come on computer, wake up!
SFX: Computer wake up noise (SJ note: I know they don’t normally make these, but for audio vibes let’s go with it)
ZORA
Okay, it’s on. Wait, what’s that?
ROHAN
Looks like a maze to me.
ZORA
That’s how their passwords work here? That’s...very cool.
ROHAN
Hang on, that maze looks mighty familiar...
SFX: Rifling into pocket
ROHAN
I knew it! Look – it’s on the back of my worksheet. 
ZORA
Okay – that will help us. I’ll click password reminder first and see what that does..
SFX: Click

NOTE FOR EVERYONE (from Mairi)
The kids encounter a locked screen and for whatever narrative reason this contains the important thing they're looking for. Some piece of data. It needs a password, but the password box isn't like anything they've ever seen before. It looks like a maze. Someone makes a joke about 2FA getting out of hand. But Zora is like "don't worry, I'll hit password reminder" and then they get the red wibbly screen. At first it looks like she broke it, but then they realise there's actually a code in there. The code translates to PW PURPLE (it fits on the yoto, dw). The two kids then discuss "Password Purple, what does that mean?" etc. They go back to the maze, and realise they have to trace a path through the maze in order to get to purple. I.E. They can click and drag to draw a line between the RED and the BLUE to make PURPLE.
What follows is a 5-choice maze, if you see the image below it would go LRRLR from RED to BLUE. I have some finessing around how to indicate that you START at RED, but tis not a concern right now.

Note from Alex: 2FA might be a bit technical for kids
more like 'it's one of those weird things where you have to prove you're not a robot'
Alice: why would anyone exclude robots - rude!

ZORA

ROHAN
Do you think it’s got a virus? Can we can catch it??

No! Let me think...

Natalia, I have my concerns about your...mission – and I know you do, too. We’ve talked about this. We’ve told Lumera to stop digging, so put down the shovel. Please. As you’re well aware, the government is facing a...budget shortfall. This solution saves us billions and gives schools across the country what they desperately need. Surely you agree with that?
ROHAN
Agree with what?
ZORA
I don’t know. Ask him something that makes him tell us more?

GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
(laughs, slight menace)
Well, you would know, wouldn’t you?
ROHAN
(as Natalia)
Would I now?
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
Yes. You’ve been watching it all. Your mole?
(Australian accent)
‘Your man on the inside?’
(regular voice)
He’s in danger. And so is Lumera.
SFX: Button click.
ZORA
(shocked, but steely)
He’s talking about Mr Boyd!

COMMS ROOM

ALICE replays the text from 20500


//WE COULD CUT THIS ROOM AND PUZZLE COMPLETELY, FYI.
(Having said that I kind of like it now)//

All the information is about Mr Boyd. 
Perhaps they are all sound clips of Mr Boyd and they need to figure out which one has been manipulated/is a lie/something he would never ever say – which means a quite shocking one is the truth...
Maybe the one that's a lie is that Mr Boyd loves AI. Or he cannot wait to set up his AIden etc. This puzzle starts digging into the ethics of it all. 


//The next room is a sort of telephone exchange where messages are being relayed. There are four voices. A.L.I.C.E chimes in and says that since they’re been doing so well, try this out. One of these agents is a double-crossing rat, but which one. 
Zora and Rohan have to work together to match who should be speaking to whom, and also figure out which one of them is an imposter. The agents are all talking about Mr Boyd in this multi-step puzzle.//

[Pixel Art Brief]The thing in my head is one of those old school switchboards?? but probably too ancient a reference for the kids? maybe a pan across some kind of audio desk with four play buttons / volume knobs - the idea being you play each section of audio in turn?

NOTES FROM MAIRI TO TEAM
This puzzle works due to the HIERARCHY of the agents only.
Character A has to mention rebooting the security system.
Character D has to mention "I'll take Amber's lead".
Otherwise... Exactly what they say about Mr Boyd is pretty inconsequential so we can rewrite for the story!

 First you figure out that Mr White (the tech expert) is person A because he's the only one who would reboot the system. B is a female voice addressing Ruby, so by process of elimination she must be Amber. Which leaves D as Violet. But Violet is the "head" security guard, so no way he would take Amber (Junior Security)'s lead. He must be an impostor.
 
To make it more obvious, we can hide something in what Violet (D) says that is a clear lie about Mr Boyd if we want.

Hello? Yes, this is she.

Oh, hello there. It’s...great to hear from you.

To what do I owe this pleasure? Oh..I thought you might be in parliament today? By eight this evening. I see...Pardon? In two minutes? Well, that’s rather short notice, but yes. Of course.

I understand that, but I’m sorry – I have no idea what you’re talking about. I absolutely did not meet with him today...that’s impossible.
(laughs)
I’ve been in back to back meetings all day...
(sternly)
Listen. I would remember. It did not occur...
(getting cross)
No! I don’t want to meet him next week! I have an organisation to run, and urgent matters to attend to. Unless there’s an agenda, I don’t have time. Good day.

How’s it looking, ALICE? Just how close are they to knowing the truth?
SFX: ALICE calculating noise.
ALICE
The outlook is...poor to fair. There’s a 75% chance this mission will fail. 
MR BOYD
Run the calculations again – that can’t be the case!
ALICE
That’s futile, Agent Boyd. If I recall correctly, you were aware of these odds prior to the mission’s initiation.
A beat.

Excuse me. I’m needed elsewhere.

NATALIA
So. In addition to the rather strange phone call I had with a government advisor a moment ago – who said we’d had a ‘special meeting’ earlier this afternoon – I’ve also noticed the interrogation room was accessed forty-five minutes ago, yet no interrogations we’re scheduled in the calendar. Alice, can you confirm the room was not used this afternoon. 
A beat.
NATALIA
Alice?
SFX: ALICE digital sigh.
NATALIA
(anger rising)
Alice! Can you confirm the interrogation room was not used this afternoon?
A beat.
ALICE
No.
NATALIA
No?

No, I cannot confirm if the interrogation room was used this afternoon.

It’s wonderful to see you again, Mrs Barrett – and at such short notice, too. 
MRS BARRETT
Rose, please! Call me, Rose. The pleasure’s is all mine.

The construction seems like it’s moving full steam ahead – or should we say ‘cloud’ these days?
(braying laugh)
MRS BARRETT
(tittering laugh)
Indeed. We’re ahead of schedule it seems. 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
Good, good. Listen, I just wanted to stop by, in person, to let you know I had a...very fruitful meeting this afternoon, to play a little game of... 
(Australian accent)
whack-a-mole.
MRS BARRETT
(surprised)
Hmmmm...You did?
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
I did. You shall be bothered no longer, Mrs Barrett. I can assure you. The wheels are really in motion now. That new building equals one thousand new students.

It does...
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
One thousand new students equals...

One thousand more minds for Aiden.

Yes. And many, many thousands of pounds for you, Rose....

We’ll meet to discuss what rebooting her would look like...I understand that, I do – but if we cannot put our trust in her – how can any of our agents, or our clients....she’s got to go.
