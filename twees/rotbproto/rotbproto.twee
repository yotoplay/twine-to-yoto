Perfect! Except...hmmm...I think you’re missing a little something. That’s right, you need to decide what kind of hero you’re going to be! To figure that out, we’ll head to the busy seaside town of Waterdeep, where our story begins...

[[|03Marketplace]]


:: 03Marketplace {"position":"600,175","size":"100,100"}
The bustling sounds of a marketplace. Very “opening of the animated Beauty and the Beast” vibes.

MERCHANT 1
Spells! Magic Items! Potions! You need ‘em, we got ‘em.

MERCHANT 2
Your sword may be sharp, but will your shield work in battle? Come by Riven Shield Shop for the best in previously-owned weapons and armor. Satisfaction guaranteed!

MERCHANT 3
(in a distinctive voice)
Get your meat pies here! Belmonder’s Meats is now serving flaming meat pies from our cart right here on the High Road. Fiery and flavorful!

NARRATOR
Waterdeep has been called the City of Splendors - a place where anything can happen and adventure is around every corner, and often deep underneath the city itself, in the dungeons of the Undermountain. Up on the surface, Waterdeep’s bustling streets are always full of people working, playing, shopping, and --
A crash and a crack! Voices overlap briefly in the aftermath as people in the crowd gasp/shout.

JUNA (she is an unnamed
townsperson at this
moment)
I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to..

NARRATOR
Oh no! That merchant’s cart has broken free of its ties and is rolling down the street!

MERCHANT 3
Somebody stop it! My meat pies!
Crowd noises and the noise of a rolling cart. voices from the crowd saying things like “Get way!” or “Watch out!”

 [[|07MageHand]]
 [[|08MoldEarth]]


:: 07MageHand {"position":"225,650","size":"100,100"}
Mage Hand! You reach out with the floating, ghostly hand as if it were your own, grabbing a broom from in front of a nearby store and shoving it through the gaps in the cart’s wheels to stop them from turning. The cart slides forward, and for a moment it seems as if it will keep going - but you hold firm until it jerks to a halt.

[[]]

[[|13WFire]]


:: 08MoldEarth {"position":"375,650","size":"100,100"}
Mold Earth! You take dirt from an empty patch of road on a side street, moving a cube almost big enough to fit a person inside, and shape it into a small dirt wall right in front of the cart’s wheels. The cart slams into the wall, jerking to a halt.

While you’ve learned each of these skills to get yourself ready for combat, it isn’t the only thing they’re perfect for. Right now, you can put your training to use to stop that runaway cart, by either throwing your shield under the wheels of the cart, or using a rope to lasso the wheels and pull with all your might.

[[|11Shield]]
[[|12Rope]]


:: 11Shield {"position":"825,650","size":"100,100"}
You grab your shield and toss it, careful to avoid anyone standing in the street. Your aim is perfect, and the shield skids to a stop just in front of the cart, wedging itself between the front wheel and the ground below. The cart shifts to the side as the wheel stops, coming to a halt in the middle of the street.

[[|13FFire]]


:: 12Rope {"position":"975,650","size":"100,100"}
You take your rope from the side of your pack and quickly tie it into a lasso, whipping it around your head and flinging it at a giant wooden meat pie carving on top of the cart. With a whooshing sound, your lasso flies through the air and wraps around the decoration, pulling tight in your hands. You yank back with all your might, using your strength to hold the rope tight and slow the cart to a halt.

Unfortunately, when the cart stops, the meat pies keep going, hurtling through the air, one after another, hitting windows and doors. Splotch. Splotch. Splotch. Even worse, one of them is still on fire. It tumbles end over end, and lands right on the straw overhang of the nearby building. Splotch-hiss! The straw immediately bursts into flames, sending smoke and fire into Weirdbottle’s Concoctions, a shop that sells all kinds of potions, and a small home next door to it.

 JUNA
I got this! So sorry! Let me just...

NARRATOR
A dwarf about your age chases down the street after the cart. Her legs are as short as the rest of her, but she is moving quickly, her blue tunic flapping as she runs. A staff carved from a piece of wood is strapped to her back, hitting just about everything she passes. As she catches up to the house that the flames are starting to light up, she gestures with her hands and reaches towards the fire, casting the spell Control Flames. Instantly, the bulk of the flames extinguish, leaving thick smoke behind.

JUNA
Okay, that part’s done. Now all I need to do is...
Another clatter.

JUNA
Oh, sorry, sorry! I didn’t mean to bonk you like that with my staff. I hope you’re okay. I hope everyone’s okay in there - the smoke looks pretty thick.

TYRADEL
(in the distance. He is
projecting but also gives the sense of being soft- spoken)
Almost everyone is okay. I’ve checked the place and am leading a few people out now, but there’s still a young boy in there who needs help. I think he’s frightened by the smoke!

JUNA (out loud) Oh, thank you!
(to herself, mostly) Where did he come from?
 
NARRATOR
Where did he come from? You’re not exactly sure, but somehow, in the middle of the confusion, an elf wearing a green shirt and leather wraps made his way into the smoky building without being noticed, and is now leading out several members of a gnome family from the burning house.

GNOME 1
And it came flying right our way, like a deliciously dangerous fireball.

GNOME 2
Luckily this fellow was here as soon as the fire was put out, ready to lend a helping hand. Thank you so much, kind stranger.

TYRADEL
Oh...sure, of course. I’ve uh...dropped some letters off for you before, actually, but I’m sure you don’t remember me.

GNOME 2
What’s that he said? Dropped off some lettuce?

GNOME 1
Letters, I think. Though nothing wrong with some lettuce.
There is a cry in the distance.

GNOME 2
Wait! That sounds like Jax! Our apprentice. He must still be inside!

JAX
(coughing as he speaks)
I can’t - having trouble - smoke is so thick...
A lute begins strumming nearby.

BATS
You’re going to be okay, I promise. Just listen, and feel the Heroism in your heart.
(singing - a soothing folk
song, but with some soulful oomph behind it a la a Tracy Chapman)
Jax starts singing along, first weakly and then with more gusto.
Don’t you worry about a thing.
 Listen to the song that I sing. One
 foot left and one foot right.
 You’ll come through your troubles
 alright.
 
 JAX AND BATS
 One foot left -

 And one foot right

 And you’ll come through your

Dancing Lights! With those words and a gesture, you create four glowing balls of light in the middle of the smoky room.

They will only glow a little, but
they should give enough light to help the lost apprentice find the door.

You have things to do and with so many other adventurers nearby, you’re sure they have things taken care of. As you walk towards your next stop in Waterdeep, you hear cheers in the distance and a little bit of laughter. You glance back to see a kobold, a dwarf, and an elf giving each other high-fives. Maybe they would have been fun to know, you think, as you go back to your same-old life. Maybe you could have gone on an adventure.

Your story ends here. To begin your adventure again and take different path, press the left button.

One foot left - turn the knob - one foot right - push it forward - and I’m out. I made it!

 BATS
I knew you would. Now you just need a little healing and you’re ready for what’s next! Just like in the adventuring tales!

NARRATOR
The singer is a kobold, a small reptilian creature whose white shirt and purple pants accentuate the red and yellow of their scales. They carry a eight-stringed lute, which they’ve now slung over their back.

TYRADEL
Thanks for the song, bard. I was worried the apprentice might panic, but you stopped him from being too scared.

BATS
Always happy to help my fellow adventurers! I’m Batsireithal (Note: BAT-sur-ay-thul), but everyone calls me Bats for short. And you?

TYRADEL
Tyradel (Note: TIER-uh-dell). And I don’t know if I would call myself an adventurer. I deliver the mail, mostly. And I wouldn’t have been able to do anything without whoever stopped the fire in the first place. That was you, yes?

JUNA
That was me, Juna (Note: June-ah). Soon-to-be member of the Emerald Enclave druid circle. Hopefully.

BATS
The Emerald Enclave?

JUNA
Yeah. I know a lot of folks think druids are always off by ourselves, communing with nature, and sometimes we are, ‘cause that’s where we get our magic, but sometimes it’s fun to be with others in a druid circle, see what we can do together.

I’m hoping joining the Enclave is like that for me.

TYRADEL
I get that. Sometimes delivering the mail on my own can get a little lonely. Do you know how the cart got started rolling, anyway?

JUNA
I hit it. Not on purpose, of course, but it happened all the same. I was leaning over, taking a look at a clover on the ground, next to a stone that I was thinking of adding to my collection, and my staff swung wide and next thing you know, boom!

Which reminds me, thank you for getting the cart stopped - if it had run into a store, or someone shopping, it would have been much worse. More than I could handle.

BATS
Seems like the four of us make a good team. Got a wizard who can stop a cart and clear the smoke, a druid who can put out fires, a rogue making their way quickly through the shadows, and a bard like me to sing about it all!

TYRADEL
We did make a pretty good team...maybe we should stay in touch? It’s always good to have other folks to rely on in case anything goes wrong. Not that it will. Bu just in case.

JUNA
Absolutely. I have to run now - go help the merchant collect all those meat pies (and probably write him an apology note), but let’s get together soon. Always good to know more people in Waterdeep!

NARRATOR
And so you collect each other’s names and details - Juna the druid dwarf, Bats the kobold bard, Tyradel the elven rogue, and you, the talented wizard.

And with promises that you’ll meet again soon, you head off in separate directions, wondering when you might see each other next. Turns out you don’t have to wait long at all, because while you were stopping carts and saving gnomes from smoke, someone was watching...

INT. XANATHAR’S HOME (NIGHT)

The last thing you remember, you were falling asleep. On your bed. Not this cold stone floor. Which isn’t your cold stone floor.

Nothing is familiar in this place.
Not the soft fuzziness of the black velvet carpet, or the tall wooden bookcases against the walls, or the plump brown couches, or the short square tables, or the two closed doors that look very, very locked.

Your backpack is here, even though you don’t remember putting it on, but your spellbook is missing from your supplies. Until you find it, you’ll have to stick to the collection of spells you memorized when you first started learning magic.

Hopefully you won’t face anything too dangerous.

BATS
What the - how’d I get here? Better question - how’d you all get here?

NARRATOR
You recognize that voice. It’s Bats, the kobold bard you met earlier today, sitting in the middle of the room next to Juna, the druid dwarf with the hard-to- control quarterstaff, and Tyradel, the mail-carrying elf rogue. That can’t be an accident.

TYRADEL
I was...just sleeping, and then--

JUNA
Then I ended up here. It has to be connected to that fire from earlier somehow, but I can’t figure out what that would have to do with this place.

BATS
Whatever the connection is, I’d feel better if we were all out of here.

TYRADEL
Agreed...I don’t like closed-in rooms like this. I need room to move.

JUNA
And I feel better when I can get my feet on natural ground. Are the doors locked?

TYRADEL
From what I can see, yeah. It’s possible that I might be able to unlock them, but I don’t have my normal lockpicking tools, so I’m not sure.

Sometimes I have to pick a few locks to get the mail dropped off properly. Good training for a rogue...and a good way to put together enough gold to travel in style.

BATS
You may not need to do that. Let me see if I can talk to whoever’s on the other side of that door.
A bards’ music is magic - why not use that magic to change their mind?

JUNA
Whatever we decide, I think we should find out what’s waiting on the other side first. I can turn into a spider and creep through that gap under the door, report back what I learn.

BATS
I’ve heard of that. The Wild Shape of the druids. Do you think you’ll find anything?

JUNA
I think it’s worth a try. Unless you’re set on doing something right now?

Hello! Is anyone out there?

You do have a spell that could do the trick. Shocking Grasp. It’ll send an electric zap to anyone you touch.

The guard walks you through a set of winding hallways and out of the door, back onto the streets of Waterdeep, which is where our story ends.

 Some musical or audio cue that gives a sense that Juna has begun her transformation.

I wonder what it would feel like to be a spider. Nobody notices you, right, because you’re so small and you can sneak into corners.

JUNA
Good thing those guards didn’t see a thing. Still, they seem like they’re watching pretty closely, and they’ve got a lot better armor than any of us do.

TYRADEL
I barely have a single lockpick. Not sure any of us put up a good fight.

BATS
Then maybe we shouldn’t. I believe in adventure, but a good adventurer knows when to advance and when to sit back.

JUNA
And when to even the odds. Now that we know there are two guards, maybe there’s a way to get one of them to leave?

BATS
I’ll pretend to be sick. With a little bit of Charm Person thrown in, I can get the guard to take me off somewhere to recover while the rest of you get the jump on the other one.

JUNA
I like it. I can do Wild Shape one more time before I need a bit of a rest. This time, I’ll pick wolf.

And there must be something around here our fighter can use as a weapon.

TYRADEL
A fireplace poker - there! And I see a few books I can use to hit them with from the shadows. Once you’re gone, we’ll strike out before the door closes again.

JUNA 
Perfect. We ready?

Ready. 
(to the guard) Oh! Oh, I think I tripped over something in here. Can you help me? Please?

Sound of the door opening.

GUARD 1 
Tripped over what?

BATS
I don’t know. But I think I need medical help. Please? There must be somewhere I can lie down.

GUARD 1
I’m not falling for that. I don’t care how nice you seem. But I can go grab you a healing potion, just in case.

(to the other guard) Will you be okay here for a minute by yourself?

GUARD 2
I’ll be fine. How much harm can they do?

NARRATOR
As soon as the first guard rounds the corner away from the hallway, before the second guard can close the door, all of you are on him.

Juna the wolf jumps up to hit his armor with her paws, Tyradel wields books as weapons from the corner, and Bats gives you all a boost of energy that makes you feel like anything is possible. The guard yells, but you have the advantage and you’ve almost got them right where you want them.

Until, in a flash faster than the blink of an eye, you’re no longer fighting. You’re sitting, back on the couch, right where you were when you woke up, with a huge floating creature in front of you.

XANATHAR
That’s enough of that. Though I do admire the effort. You’ll need some of that spirit where you’re going.

Xanathar? The Xanathar? Head of the Thieves’ Guild? Powerful and ruthless? Dastardly but cunning?

XANATHAR
What an introduction. Yes, that Xanathar. In the flesh. Which not many get to witness, so I do hope you appreciate it.

NARRATOR
The Xanathar is a creature called a beholder. Like all beholders, Xanathar has a central eyeball in the middle of a large rounded head, directly above a large fanged mouth.

Eyestalks, each one like a long, flexible telescope ending in an eyeball, extend from the beholder’s head in several different directions, swiveling this way and that as they float into the room.

XANATHAR (laughing)
It seems that you have at least heard of me, so that’s one thing made easier. Whatever it is that you’ve heard, one thing that is 100% true is that sometimes my friends and I have to bring in new talent for special jobs. That’s where you come in. The fire you helped to deal with in the market today? It wasn’t an accident.

JUNA
Wait. I don’t understand. I was the one who bumped into the merchant and sent his cart flying.

XANATHAR
That’s what someone wanted you to think. It’s what they wanted me to think. When really, this was a plot for a group of thieves to use a trap door near where the fire was set, and steal something from me during the confusion. Have you heard of the Ring of Three Wishes?

JUNA 
No.

TYRADEL 
Maybe once?

BATS
It’s a Ring that grants three wishes to whoever wears it. I’ve heard some of the other bards tell the most amazing tales about how it has been lost and recovered over the years.

XANATHAR
Precisely. And now I need it to be recovered once again.

The thieves took the Ring down beneath the city to Undermountain, and I want it back before they do something horrible with it. I’m willing to pay very well if you can retrieve it for me. How does 50 gold pieces each sound to you?

TYRADEL
I don’t understand. Don’t you have a whole thieves’ guild? Why wouldn’t you send out one of your own?

XANATHAR (somewhat snappishly)
Because I am sure that one of them put this team together and stole it from me. And while I don’t know any of you, I am certain that you just met today, and I heard that you worked well together in the market. And just now, you reacted to waking up here much better than most. You’re who I want...and I usually get what I want.

(beat)

Still, to be polite, I’ll give you a moment to discuss while I speak to your guards about their recent decisions.

The party lower their voices to whispers for this section.

JUNA
I am not a fan of that Xanathar. Something about him makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.

TYRADEL
Nothing I’ve heard about the thieves’ guild has ever been that good either. Even for thieves, they are cut-throat.

BATS
Which is why Xanathar needs us. The thieves’ guild are all busy stabbing each other in the back. That means there’s room for us to be the heroes of the day, and make sure the Ring doesn’t fall into the wrong hands.

I’m not saying we become friends
with Xanathar, but it could be that whoever behind this is even worse!

That’s what someone wanted you to think. It’s what they wanted me to think. When really, this was a plot for a group of thieves to use a trap door near where the fire was set, and steal something from me during the confusion. Have you heard of the Ring of Three Wishes?

JUNA 
No.

TYRADEL 
Maybe once?

BATS
It’s a Ring that grants three wishes to whoever wears it. I’ve heard some of the other bards tell the most amazing tales about how it has been lost and recovered over the years.

XANATHAR
Precisely. And now I need it to be recovered once again.

The thieves took the Ring down beneath the city to Undermountain, and I want it back before they do something horrible with it. I’m willing to pay very well if you can retrieve it for me. How does 50 gold pieces each sound to you?

TYRADEL
I don’t understand. Don’t you have a whole thieves’ guild? Why wouldn’t you send out one of your own?

XANATHAR (somewhat snappishly)
Because I am sure that one of them put this team together and stole it from me. And while I don’t know any of you, I am certain that you just met today, and I heard that you worked well together in the market. And just now, you reacted to waking up here much better than most. You’re who I want...and I usually get what I want.

(beat)

Still, to be polite, I’ll give you a moment to discuss while I speak to your guards about their recent decisions.

The party lower their voices to whispers for this section.

JUNA
I am not a fan of that Xanathar. Something about him makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.

TYRADEL
Nothing I’ve heard about the thieves’ guild has ever been that good either. Even for thieves, they are cut-throat.

BATS
Which is why Xanathar needs us. The thieves’ guild are all busy stabbing each other in the back. That means there’s room for us to be the heroes of the day, and make sure the Ring doesn’t fall into the wrong hands.

I’m not saying we become friends
with Xanathar, but it could be that whoever behind this is even worse!

TYRADEL (to listener)
What do you think?

XANATHAR
I am sure you would make a lovely member of the Emerald Enclave of druids, Juna, but with the right word whispered into the right ear, I can make sure that they will never accept you. And Tyradel, you enjoy your job delivering letters and training for your life as a rogue on the road? Good luck keeping it after I get through with you.

TYRADEL 
Please don’t do that.

XANATHAR
I won’t, if you do as I ask. Just as I won’t make sure that Batsireithal here -

BATS 
Bats.

XANATHAR
That “Bats” won’t have their entire life as an adventurer ruined before it even gets going. And you, there - I won’t even get into all the ways I could destroy your dreams. Better that you all just go along with what I want, don’t you think?

JUNA, BATS, AND TYRADEL (resignedly, after a bit.)
Okay.

Wonderful. Follow me.

EXT. ARCH GATE IN FRONT OF UNDERMOUNTAIN Footsteps as the group walks together.

NARRATOR
Undermountain. A series of chambers and lairs that stretches beneath the surface of Waterdeep. Xanathar leads your group through the busy stone streets filled with those seeking magic, fortune, and fame, leading you to what appears to be an archway, chiseled right into a blank wall.

XANATHAR
And here we are. Do you know anything about the arch gates of Undermountain?

TYRADEL
I do. I’ve had to go almost everywhere in the area to deliver letters. You walk through one and it can take you much, much further down in the mountain. Great shortcut, as long as you know where you’re going, and how to get back.
(suddenly a bit embarrassed by how much he’s talking)
Which I...uh...do. Most of the time anyway.

XANATHAR
Very right, Tyradel. And this particular arch will take you to the last place where the thieves who stole the Ring were spotted.

TYRADEL
And you want us to just track them from there?

JUNA
I can look for some signs of where someone has passed through, but to be honest, I’m better at tracking animals than people.

XANATHAR
I trust that with your skills, you will be able to figure something out. And of course, I have returned your equipment to you, to make sure you have the best possible chance of success. I also have an item that will help.

BATS 
A pendant?

TYRADEL
A tracking pendant, probably.

XANATHAR
Exactly. I know it doesn’t look like much now - just a flat piece of silver with a dull blue gem in the center, but the closer that you get to the Ring, the brighter it will glow. The rest, I leave to you.

An audio cue of Xanathar’s departure would be great here.

BATS
I never thought I would meet Xanathar and I’m not too happy to be working for them, but what s done is done. It’s up to us. Just like in the stories! You ready?

TYRADEL
Not completely, but I’m just going to think about it as if I was picking up a package that doesn’t quite want to be found.

JUNA
I’m excited. Think of all the interesting things we might find down there - maybe a few to add to my collection of stones and plants from around the city.

BATS
And I know you’re up for anything. You’re an adventurer through and through. So let’s go!

Sound of going through a magical arch.

TYRADEL
A cavern. I guess that’s to be expected. Once you get past this echoey entrance, there’s got to be so many out-of-the-way tunnels and caverns in here where thieves could hide things.

BATS
Maybe. But what kind of thieves hide in a cave with a huge dragon in it? You see that? There, at the end of that long stone bridge, just sitting there? A real, honest-to- goodness gold dragon! The gold wings, the long curvy tail, that face full of teeth...

JUNA
Not a full grown dragon, I don’t think. Looks smaller than that. Probably a wyrmling. Young and just getting started.

TYRADEL
Even a young dragon is plenty tough though, right?

JUNA
If it wants to hurt us, oh yeah. We’d better start running right now. But the metal dragons, like this one, and the bronze and copper types - a lot of them are really kind.

BATS
And wise. Gold dragons care about justice, the way all good heroes should, so we’re on the same side of things.

TYRADEL
I don’t know. I think should try to get rid somehow. Take it out.
In case it decides that we’re on the wrong side of things. Maybe it can smell Xanathar on us - you never know.

BATS
I didn’t think about that. Dragons are smarter than that, but this is a young one.

TYRADEL
Young enough that maybe we can at least knock it out? If we strike quickly?

JUNA
Or we could talk to it, ask if it’s seen the thieves. Maybe it has some information that could help. We don’t have to jump right into an attack. We can have a conversation.

BATS
I’m all for that. Dragons are mighty creatures - better to have one on our side.

WYRMLING EFFECT - INT. CAVERN

GOLD WYRMLING ASTOTH You can pretend not to know what I’m talking about if you’d like, but do you think the Zhentarim could go wandering through the caverns where we’ve made our home without us noticing? Why do you think I came here to meet you?

TYRADEL
(he is somewhat impressed by the Zhentarim)

The Zhentarim? That’s the group of mercenaries who take money to do dangerous jobs that no one else will.

BATS
And for good reason. They’re as ruthless as Xanathar is. I thought that’s why they had the whole group run out of the city a few years back.

TYRADEL
Whatever they are, we’re not with them. We’re adventurers come to track them down.

JUNA
They stole something from...someone we know.

GOLD WYRMLING ASTOTH
Perhaps, but I learned a long time ago not to believe what the strangers who come down here happen to say. Whatever you came for, I suggest you turn around and return there. And if you do wish to proceed, let’s make sure you don’t quite have the energy to try to harm me or the means to get to me.

Astoth breathes in a roarlike burst. The party reacts with muffled shouts.

TYRADEL
What was that? I feel like that wyrmling just breathed something into me with that roar, and suddenly everything feels heavier.

BATS
Breath weapon. That’s what dragons do. That’s why they’re so powerful. This feels like weakening breath - I can hardly move.

JUNA
Better than fire breath. I think this is the wyrmling giving us a chance. They’ll figure out the truth once we get the Ring back.
(beat) Hopefully, anyway.

TYRADEL
You’re right. The dragon didn’t try to kill us when it had us down, and the weakening breath is only temporary. I feel like I’m getting my strength back already, even if it is a bit like my feet are stuck to the ground with gum.

JUNA
Same here. We should take our time crossing the bridge. No point in rushing and falling into the emptiness below - it looks like it goes on for days.

BATS 
Helloooo!

Bats’ voice echoes back.

BATS
Echo--oh!

Bats’ calling out of echo ends in a yelp accompanied by the sound of falling rocks that echo in the cavern below.

 NARRATOR
Bats slips, their feet losing their grip. If they don’t right themselves, they’ll plummet to the cavern below!

NARRATOR
Using your quick reflexes, you reach out with your hand and grab the back of their shirt, pulling them back onto the walkway. They smile in your direction with a tip of their head.

BATS (to Listener)
Thank you so much friend. If you hadn’t taken action, who knows how far I might have fallen. Let’s get across the rest of this as fast as we can.

Sound of footsteps to mark the crossing of the cavern.

JUNA
There. We’re safely across. Can you tell which way the wyrmling went? It looks like there are two passageways up ahead.

BATS 
I didn’t see.

TYRADEL
Me neither. And the pendant glowing, so that’s no help.

BATS
I don’t know that it matters. See? The path to the left is blocked by those rocks. We’d have to move them all to go forward. I’m not sure I’m strong enough.

NARRATOR
Bats is right. Where the tunnel would have normally been, a pile of rocks blocks the path, one on top of the other.

JUNA
That isn’t the only issue. See the gap in front of the other passageway? It’s way too far to jump.

TYRADEL
Did the dragon do that?

JUNA
I think so. It looks like there used to be a rock bridge here, but now there’s just swipe marks.

BATS
Dragons can fly, so what do they care?

Might as well stop us from going any further. Not that we’re gonna let it, right?

TYRADEL
Not at all. In fact, I think we may be able to use this passage. We just need to get past all the rocks.
(to listener)
I know you’ve got the strength to handle that sword and bow - you think that you could use your shield to dig them out of here? Then we can move forward without having to worry about going through the gap.

JUNA 
Great idea.
(to listener) 
Can you do it?

NARRATOR
You can. It takes a little time, and a few breaks, and your new friends help as best they can, until the way forward is cleared.

BATS
Perfect! Pretty sure we can get through now.

TYRADEL
Hopefully the dragon hasn’t blocked any other pathways. We’ll just have to move carefully.

WYRMLING EFFECT - INT. CAVERN

GOLD WYRMLING ASTOTH You can pretend not to know what I’m talking about if you’d like, but do you think the Zhentarim could go wandering through the caverns where we’ve made our home without us noticing? Why do you think I came here to meet you?

TYRADEL
(he is somewhat impressed by the Zhentarim)

The Zhentarim? That’s the group of mercenaries who take money to do dangerous jobs that no one else will.

BATS
And for good reason. They’re as ruthless as Xanathar is. I thought that’s why they had the whole group run out of the city a few years back.

TYRADEL
Whatever they are, we’re not with them. We’re adventurers come to track them down.

JUNA
They stole something from...someone we know.

GOLD WYRMLING ASTOTH
Perhaps, but I learned a long time ago not to believe what the strangers who come down here happen to say. Whatever you came for, I suggest you turn around and return there. And if you do wish to proceed, let’s make sure you don’t quite have the energy to try to harm me or the means to get to me.

Astoth breathes in a roarlike burst. The party reacts with muffled shouts.

TYRADEL
What was that? I feel like that wyrmling just breathed something into me with that roar, and suddenly everything feels heavier.

BATS
Breath weapon. That’s what dragons do. That’s why they’re so powerful. This feels like weakening breath - I can hardly move.

JUNA
Better than fire breath. I think this is the wyrmling giving us a chance. They’ll figure out the truth once we get the Ring back.
(beat) Hopefully, anyway.

TYRADEL
You’re right. The dragon didn’t try to kill us when it had us down, and the weakening breath is only temporary. I feel like I’m getting my strength back already, even if it is a bit like my feet are stuck to the ground with gum.

JUNA
Same here. We should take our time crossing the bridge. No point in rushing and falling into the emptiness below - it looks like it goes on for days.

BATS 
Helloooo!

Bats’ voice echoes back.

BATS
Echo--oh!

Bats’ calling out of echo ends in a yelp accompanied by the sound of falling rocks that echo in the cavern below.

NARRATOR
Bats slips, their feet losing their grip. If they don’t right themselves, they’ll plummet to the cavern below!

NARRATOR
Quickly, you case Mold Earth, using some of the ground behind you to extend the walkway beneath their feet and give them a little solid ground. With a smile, they catch their footing, hop back on to the path, and give you a nod.

BATS (to Listener)
Thank you so much friend. If you hadn’t taken action, who knows how far I might have fallen. Let’s get across the rest of this as fast as we can.

Sound of footsteps to mark the crossing of the cavern.

JUNA
There. We’re safely across. Can you tell which way the wyrmling went? It looks like there are two passageways up ahead.

BATS 
I didn’t see.

TYRADEL
Me neither. And the pendant glowing, so that’s no help.

BATS
I don’t know that it matters. See? The path to the left is blocked by those rocks. We’d have to move them all to go forward. I’m not sure I’m strong enough.

NARRATOR
Bats is right. Where the tunnel would have normally been, a pile of rocks blocks the path, one on top of the other.

JUNA
That isn’t the only issue. See the gap in front of the other passageway? It’s way too far to jump.

TYRADEL
Did the dragon do that?

JUNA
I think so. It looks like there used to be a rock bridge here, but now there’s just swipe marks.

BATS
Dragons can fly, so what do they care?

Might as well stop us from going any further. Not that we’re gonna let it, right?

BATS
I don’t think any of us can move that whole pile of rocks, but there has to be a way across that gap. Could you turn into a bird, maybe?

JUNA
No. None of the wild shapes I know now can fly. And even if they could, that just gets me across. It doesn’t help the rest of you. I could maybe become a spider, but again - that doesn’t help anyone else. We need a way across that everyone can use.

NARRATOR
As you think about Juna taking the shape of a spider and climbing across the rocks, you have an idea. Without a word, you pull out your trusty spellbook from your pack. Yes, there it is. Web. A spell that creates a spider’s web between two points. You can build it across the gap, and it’ll last just long enough to get everyone across.

BATS
Oh, our wizard’s got an idea! I can feel it.

NARRATOR
You nod and begin to cast, creating thick strands of spiderweb that stretch from where the dragon swiped down the stone pathway to the entrance to the passageway in the distance, quickly covering the 40 or 50 feet between them.

JUNA
Who needs a spider when you’ve got their web? Let’s get across quickly, before the spell fades.

BATS
It’s a little sticky, and I keep getting my arm wrapped up, but it’s better than falling to the cavern floor.

TYRADEL
Absolutely. No wonder everyone wants a wizard around.

EXT. THE SHADOWY PATH

JUNA
I don’t know if it’s the rock fall or what, but this is a very dim path. I feel like I can barely see. What about the rest of you?

TYRADEL
I’m okay. I’ve had to go down way darker paths than this to get letters delivered, and I always made it back in mostly one piece, even when someone’s pet owlbear thought I was food and tried to eat me.

BATS
I’ve always wanted to fight an owlbear.

JUNA
And I’ve always wanted to have one as a companion. I’d make sure it didn’t eat any mail deliverers, though!

TYRADEL Thanks.

BATS
I can’t believe you can tell which way you’re going in here. Sure you don’t want me to cast a spell and get us some light?

TYRADEL
Save it for when we need it. I promise, as long as you stay right behind me, we’ll get to where we need to be.

BATS
How’d you get into delivering mail anyway? Seems like you’ve got the skills to be some kind of thief, or scout, or something.

TYRADEL
I will be, one day. A scout that is, not a thief. But in the meantime, there’s something fun in the challenge of delivering mail all across the land. Each day is like a little adventure, pulling me forward to--
A long pause as Tyradel abruptly stops speaking.

JUNA 
To?

A voice cries out in the distance, but faintly.

TYRADEL Someone’s here.

JAL
(faintly, in the distance)
Hello? Anyone? I need help here!

TYRADEL
Maybe that light would be a good thing right about now.

BATS
Sure! Watch this. I touch the lute and cast Light and it glows! I can make anything light up, really, but this is probably my favorite. And - oh. Well that’s something you don’t see every day. Someone halfway inside of one of the biggest, wobbliest cubes I’ve ever seen. You okay there?

JAL 
Do I look okay?

JUNA
You look like half of you is trapped in a giant ice cube, if I’m being honest.

JAL
It’s called a gelatinous cube.

BATS
Okay then - you look like half of you is trapped in a giant gelatinous cube, if I’m being honest.

TYRADEL
And you’re not the first one. Look at that shield there, wobbling in the middle of it. Probably got stuck in there years ago and it’s just still...there.

JAL
Well, I don’t plan to be stuck in here for the rest of my life, but I need help.

The pants I’m wearing are covered with a coating that it doesn’t like the taste of, but it’s been slowly breaking them down into just these tiny threads and that’s not a good thing for me.

JUNA
Do gelatinous cubes have taste buds? Or is it more like the way mold will grow on a rock, slowly breaking it down to its pieces? Taking things apart is just as important to nature as new things growing, you know.

JAL
And it’s important to me to be far away from this cube before I get taken apart. Can you drive this thing off or pull me free?

TYRADEL
Not so fast. We’re on the trail of a group of thieves from the Zhentarim mercenary group and I think you just might be part of it.

JAL
Me? No. I was just wandering through, looking around, and got stuck here.

JUNA
I don’t believe that.

(in a whisper)

Let’s see what he says after I use Charm Person to convince him that we’re friends.

(directing her voice at Jal)

You want to tell us the truth. We’re friends, after all, just as nature is a friend to all creatures large and small.

JAL
(slightly dazed, mimicking her speech pattern)
We’re friends. Yes. I’m Jal, and you are my friends.

TYRADEL (whispering)
It worked!

BATS
I love that spell. Keeps me out of a lot of trouble.

JUNA
So Jal, friend, what brings you here?

JAL
I am part of the Zhentarim. We were hired to steal the Ring of Three Wishes by Xanathar, who said they would let our group back into Waterdeep in return.

TYRADEL 
Hired by Xanathar?

BATS
Why would Xanathar steal their own Ring, and then send us to get it back?

JAL
I’d love to help you figure it out, but I don’t know much more and I really want to get out of here. Can you help me?

NARRATOR
As you cross to the other side and end the spell, keeping your webbing intact behind you, you enter a cavern that’s brighter than you might have expected.

TYRADEL
Wow, that is bright. Where’s all the light coming from?

JUNA
The green moss! See it creeping across the stone ceiling, and the way it glows?

BATS
I can barely see anything else. Something about that glow changes the colors of everything in the cavern, like we’re at a party for some special occasion.

TYRADEL
A party filled with very odd colored plants. Is it just me or is the grass purple?

JUNA
I’m not sure, actually. It might be that away from this light, it’s the same color as any grass you might find elsewhere in the world. I’ll have to take a sample back with me, see if I can learn more about it.
(beat)
I love this. Everything is so alive. It’s almost like the plants are part of me, guiding me where to go and what to -

A clattering sound.

JUNA Ow! Shoot! Sorry. (to listener)
Are you okay? I didn’t mean to hit you. This always happens to me.

BATS
What always happens?

TYRADEL 
Are you okay?

JUNA
I’m fine. I just always lose control of my feet when I get excited about something. It’s like I forget how to balance once my mind starts whirring away. It’s not a big deal, though. Just have to -

A sound of rustling.

TYRADEL What was that?

JUNA
Maybe a medium deal. See that plant ahead of us, there in the shadows? That’s a violet fungus.

BATS
I’ve heard of those. They are not good. They have a lot of tentacles.

NARRATOR
Indeed they do. The tentacles are growing out of a large purple bulb full of small holes that extends from the ground from a white stalk. At first, it looks like any other mushroom-like plant in this weird forest, but as you watch, the tentacles begin to wave.

JUNA
That’s really not good. I think we’ve gotten close enough that..yup. I hope you’re ready - we’re going to have to fight!

BATS
(strumming lute)
Always.

TYRADEL
(taking short sword from
holder) 
Ready.

JUNA
You ready too? I know you’ve already done a lot of spellcasting today, but it looks like you’re going to do a little more. Let’s give this plant a taste of what else nature can do, starting with a little Entangle.

Juna casts Entangle.

TYRADEL 
What is it doing?

BATS
That’s not the fungus. That’s Juna.

JUNA
With Entangle, these vines will do my bidding and hold back all those who want to hurt me.

BATS
Woah, a vine fight. They’re all wrapped up in each other, at least from what I can see.

JUNA
That should keep the fungus contained for a bit. Can you reach it with your shortsword, Tyradel?

TYRADEL Got it!

Slashing sound.

TYRADEL
I think I injured it, but it’s not quite enough.

(to listener)

Do you have anything up your sleeve that can do a little damage?

NARRATOR
You have just the thing. You cast Acid Arrow, sending a shimmering green arrow towards the fungus. It explodes in a spray of acid, showering the plant and ground underneath it.

BATS
Nice! That definitely connected - I think it’s retreating. I didn’t even need to --
A whipping sound. Juna yells.

JUNA
Ah! It hit me. Like some kind of going away present. Right here, on my hand, it’s like the skin is starting to shrivel up, and ow!

BATS 
I can help.

Bats starts playing a gentle melody as they cast Healing Word.

There. A bit of Healing Word and your pain should melt away.

JUNA
That’s so much better. Thank you. Now we just have one problem. There are bound to be a lot more of those in our path through this section of the caverns.

TYRADEL
Can you tell us where they are, Juna, help us avoid them?

JUNA
Yes, but it might take a while. Unless...

BATS
Are you going to Wild Shape into a mouse or something?

JUNA
Close. I think another spider woud be be perfect for one the job. A bigger one this time. It’ll move a little faster.

Juna uses Wild Shape to transform into a giant wolf spider.

TYRADEL 
Wow.

BATS
That is one large spider.

TYRADEL
Be careful out there, Juna.

BATS
Up there, you mean. Look at her go, right up the side of that stone wall! The view from there has got to be better.

TYRADEL
And those beady little eyes? I bet they see so much.

Sounds of spider legs on stone and then the end of Wild Shape, if there is a specific sound for it.

JUNA
That did help. For one thing, violet fungus isn’t the only danger down there. I saw a sleeping owlbear, as big as I’ve seen in pictures, and a grick along one of the walls.

BATS
A grick? I’ve heard of the owlbear - as big as a bear with the head of an owl - but that one is new to me.

JUNA
Gricks are giant worm-like creatures with tentacles and snapping beaks for mouths. They don’t usually bother you unless they’re hungry and you get too close.

TYRADEL
And you have a path that gets us past all of that?

JUNA
I do, and I’ve dropped some bits of web to mark it. Not as extensive as the web our wizard used across the gap, but it’ll do. There’s just one thing.

BATS
Whatever it is, we’re ready for it.

JUNA (laughing a bit)
Good, because we’re not alone in here. (pauses, takes a deep breath) Hello! Is anyone out there?

After a brief pause, a voice calls back from a distance.

CYANA (distantly)
Hello? Is anyone there? My name’s Cyana. I’m trapped here, and I could really use some sort of directions, and I think I just saw something moving in the shadows.

JUNA (shouting)
Don’t worry, there’s nothing too close to you right now from what I just saw. Stay where you are and we’ll head your way!
General sounds of walking, with room for a few small interjections, like...

JUNA
Watch your foot there.

TYRADEL
Do you think there are any non-Juna spiders here?

BATS 
Let’s hope not.

JUNA (to Cyana)
We’re trying our best to head your way, but there a lot of dangerous creatures in here and we don’t want to get into a fight we can’t handle.

CYANA
I understand. That’s what’s got me stuck here. I don’t know which is the safest way to go, and I don’t want to end up getting hit by some tentacle.

JUNA
Yeah, it’s not the best feeling.

TYRADEL
How’d you end up here anyway?

BATS (quietly)
Good question. I wonder if she’s one of the thieves we’re meant to be chasing.

CYANA
I...umm...was just wandering around down in these tunnels looking for something, and must have gotten turned around.

JUNA
I don’t think so. The gear that you’re wearing? Classic thief attire. And the weight of that pack? Something tells me you’re carrying a lot of gold you got from some place you shouldn’t have been. Just tell us the truth.

CYANA
(a little petulantly)
Fine. Sorry. How about this? I’ll tell you why I’m here and what you can expect ahead, and in return, you let me know the best way out of here.

TYRADEL
Why would we trust you?

CYANA
I’ll give you some information I wouldn’t want to get out. I’m a member of the Zhentarim. I don’t know if you’ve heard of us?

TYRADEL 
I have.

CYANA
Then you know we’re a group of adventurers for hire. Probably a lot like you.

BATS
Not at all like us. I’ve heard of some of the jobs you’ve taken. There’s a reason others won’t do the work you do - a lot of it is very bad stuff.

CYANA
Like stealing the Ring of Three Wishes from Xanathar’s guild?

BATS
Much worse than that.

TYRADEL
Who asked you to steal the Ring anyway?

CYANA
Xanathar. They promised that if we did, they would help bring the Zhentarim back to Waterdeep after running us out of town years ago.

JUNA
That doesn’t make sense. Why would Xanathar do that?

CYANA
Help me get out of here and I’ll tell you.

BATS
How easy is that gonna be, Juna?

JUNA
Not that easy. I can see where Cyana is, but her path is nearly all blocked in by the grick on one side and some more violet fungus on the other. Getting her out is going to take some time.

BATS
Do you think the info’s gonna be worth it, or should we just leave her to get free on her own?

But it will be fighting us.

TYRADEL
And next thing you know, it could be going for one of our legs.

BATS
I think we could take it.

JUNA
But it might take energy that we need for whatever else is in there. Including the gold dragons.

TYRADEL
Because they are dangerous.

JUNA
Because they hate Xanathar. And we’re bringing them the Ring.

True. But it feels weird to just...leave Jal there.

We’re trying to see if there’s a way to get you out of here easily, but we might work faster if you tell us how you ended up alone in this cavern. Where’s the rest of your group?

CYANA
We came here together. An abandoned dragon’s lair that Xanathar picked out for us to hide in, after we delivered the Ring. But since you can’t trust Xanathar--

BATS 
Ever.

CYANA
We wanted to see the place before turning over the Ring. And it turned out not to be as abandoned as we thought - the gold dragon wyrmlings were furious when they found out we were working for Xanathar, took the Ring, and chased us into the tunnels. We’ve been searching for it ever since, splitting up to cover more ground.

BATS
So you didn’t have back-up when you got stranded in here.

CYANA
Exactly. And now I do, right? Can you help me out of here?

JUNA
I can try, but it’s going to take some time, and we might end up having to fight.

You said you don’t know much more. So you do know some? Maybe tell us that first, before we start yanking you out of there.

JAL
There isn’t much to tell. Xanathar hired us and told us to steal the Ring, bring it to them, and then wait down here for payment.

TYRADEL
I still don’t understand why. Or why Xanathar would be okay with the Zhentarim - a group that matches them in ruthlessness - coming back to Waterdeep.

JAL
Glad to see our reputation remains intact.

BATS
Not in a good way. You all have done some pretty terrible things.

JAL
Maybe, but we haven’t gotten as far as we have without being careful. We thought we’d come check this place out first, make sure it was safe.

JUNA 
And it wasn’t.

JAL
Not even close. Those gold dragons? They hate Xanathar. Once they figured out we were working with the beholder, they attacked us. I started running, not looking where I was going.

BATS
And ended up in the cube. That’s how it happens sometimes on adventures.

You’re right. Just because something’s hard doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. We can get you out of here, Cyana, it’ll just take a minute - I’m sketching a route out. Carefully now...

BATS
Ooh, what’s that plant? I’m pretty sure it isn’t a monster. I might just grab a little...

TYRADEL
Oh, no - Bats, be careful. I’m pretty sure that’s--

The loud sound of screaming. It should continue in the backdrop for the next 2-3 lines (until noted).

BATS 
What is that sound?

TYRADEL AND JUNA 
A shrieker.

TYRADEL
Get too close and it starts making that noise. Isn’t there anything we can do to stop that? I can barely hear myself think, and I’m sure it isn’t any good for Juna’s spell.

NARRATOR
Sleep is just the thing - you cast it at the shrieker, willing it to fall into a deep magical slumber. If it’s sleeping, it can’t keep screaming.

BATS
Perfect. I was going to cast Silence, but I’d hate for us not to be able to hear each other. Is it working?

NARRATOR
It is. The creature tries to resist the urge, but soon falls asleep, ending the piercing sound.

The shrieking ends, maybe the sound of the plant falling over.

JUNA
Thank you, friend. That sound was starting to beat into my skull. I’m glad you put an end to it.

(slight beat)

Tyradel, I’m surprised you know about shriekers.

TYRADEL
All part of the job. Lots of mansions have them planted around the sides as a way to prevent thieves from getting in. I’ve learned to stay back.

JUNA
That makes sense, but one of the nice things about shriekers is that they often grow next to other fungi that are way, way cooler. See that tall mushroom there with the gray- green top?

TYRADEL 
Yes. Is it dangerous?

JUNA
Not at all. In fact, the surface of the Trillimac mushroom cap is leathery enough that it can be turned into a scroll, and its stalk can be made into a kind of bread.

Nature is always giving us new things to work with.

CYANA
Maybe you can mark down on your instructions which of the mushrooms do what? I was never good with plants and all of that.

JUNA 
Sure thing.

BATS
And weren’t you going to tell us what Xanathar is up to in return for our help?

CYANA
I’ll be honest - I lied. I don’t know. I’m new to the Zhentarim so I wasn’t doing all the high-up planning, but it was definitely Xanathar. If I had to guess, I’d say they wanted to get the Ring away from their own people without looking like they were the one taking it.

BATS
Sounds like the kind of thing Xanathar might do.

JUNA
It does. And now we’re helping them finish the job. I hope we don’t regret it.

(beat)

And there we go. Cyana, I have a route planned out that will take you from where you are to where we came in - hopefully you can make it out from there. Let me just send this piece of paper over to you on a breeze of air with a Gust spell.
Slight sound of paper floating on a breeze.

CYANA
Got it. Okay, I see. I’m here, and you’re in this direction, so if I just step forward...

JUNA
Exactly. Each square on the paper is about a single step forward.

CYANA
Perfect, thank you! Oh, and one piece of advice - in the next room, not everything is what it seems to be!

TYRADEL
Noted. I’ll have my eye out for traps and the like. Let’s go.

Bats begins to play a combat theme (maybe something that is an echo of what they played during the earlier fire scene.)

BATS
I’ll use Thunderwave to shake things up. And maybe you can add some arrows to the mix?

Bats casts Thunderwave, which is heard by the listener as a booming sound that seems to come in from off in the distance.

NARRATOR
As the booming wave of force from Bats’ spell hits the cube, you ready your bow, holding it out steady just as you were taught, and send two arrows in its direction, each of which hits solidly against the wobbly mass.
Sound of something hitting jello with a splat.

JUNA
Did you see the cube jiggle as the thunder damage hit it? It got pushed halfway back to that wall! And when the arrows hit, it moved even more. The more damage we do, the more it pulls away, and the more we can get Jal loose.

(to the listener)

I’m sure you’re tired from moving all those rocks, but can you find a way to pull Jal free while I do a little more shaking?

(to everyone)

Hold onto something, everyone! Earth Tremor coming!

Juna casts Earth Tremor - we hear the soundof an earthquake, with rocks shaking.

TYRADEL
Thanks for the warning! You called that a tremor, but it really shook the ground back and forth - glad I stayed on my feet!
(to listener)
Glad you’ve got a grip on Jal, but I think it might take a little more to get them free.

JAL
Yes - exactly! I can feel myself starting to move as you help me pull free!

I think one or two more hits and
the cube will be on its way. Maybe something a little more direct?
Sound of daggers coming out of a sheath (maybe with a little more of a metal sound than otherwise)

TYRADEL
How about two scratches right across its side? Take that!
We hear two slicing sounds, one right after the other.

TYRADEL (CONT'D)
And you, fighter? Want to get a blow in?

JAL
Just be sure not to hit me in the process!

NARRATOR
Your training kicks in as you pull your sword out and slap down on the cube with the flat of the blade, hard enough to make it pull back as you hold onto Jal with your other hand.

JAL
I think one last effort will do it. You have a strong grip there, my friend - no doubt from keeping your hands on the hilt of that sword. I think one more pull from you will do it. One, two, three...
Sound of clattering.

JAL
Perfect, thank you! And off the cube goes, slinking off to heal its wounds. Oh - ow!

TYRADEL
Did you hit something when our friend here pulled you free?

JAL
No, no. It’s just...

(a bit sheepishly)

My foot fell asleep in there. But I’ll take care of that far away from here. Thank you all, again.

I hope you find what you are looking for. Oh, and in the next room? Not everything is what it seems to be!

Jal scampers off and the party continues on.

Sorry Jal. I’m sure the Zhentarim will be by here eventually.

BATS
They may do horrible things to others, but I have always heard they take care of their own.

I sure hope so.

I hate to say it, but I agree. There’s a chance that we end up tiring ourselves out, or getting injured trying to get Cyana out of there.

TYRADEL
I’m sure the Zhentarim will come for her soon. They may be ruthless, but they take care of their own.

CYANA
Great. Back to waiting.

I’m sure they’ll be here to help you soon.

BATS
Finally through to the other side of that path! I never would have thought we’d meet a real- life...what were they called?

TYRADEL 
Zhentarim.

BATS
Exactly. And even though I know they are always up to no good, I’m pretty sure that if we need to take the Ring back from them, we can handle it.

JUNA
We just need to catch up with them first.

TYRADEL
Hopefully that’s all the excitement we get for a bit. Gotta have some ordinary streets between the exciting ones on any mail route. And this cavern looks pretty normal, though you don’t see too many caverns with such a pretty mosaic on the floor.

BATS
Feels like we’re in the abandoned hall of some old castle, instead of a dragon lair.

JUNA
I know what you mean and I think it’s all because of that pattern on the floor. I wonder who made it? Think of all the different stones that would have been collected - a bit of red there, a bit of green towards the far exit. I wonder what it’s supposed to be. A field, maybe?

TYRADEL
And do you see the treasure chest over there in the corner? It looks locked, but I could probably open it.

BATS
Wait! Before we take a step. I think this might be a trap.

JUNA
Not everything may be as it seems, right?

BATS
Exactly. I’ve heard about floors like this in dungeons. They get you all mesmerized by their prettiness and then bam, you’re zapped, or stabbed, or a rock drops on your head.

TYRADEL
I could check it out, but it’ll take a minute. Do you want to wait?

TYRADEL Checking for traps...

A sound, maybe a buzzing or a humming, and then a click (the trap being detected).

TYRADEL
100% a trap. Looks like it’s set to go off any time someone puts pressure on the mosaic - these little holes here in the rocks? They’ve got poison-tipped spikes in there, ready to be flung up as soon as it’s triggered.

BATS 
Knew it!

JUNA
Glad we checked. Slow and steady’s better than rushing ahead. Can you do anything to stop it from hitting us, though?

TYRADEL
Definitely. I’ve had to avoid more than a few traps in my time.

BATS
You have the oddest mail route. But it makes sense if you’re using it to train to be an adventurer and I’m glad it’s coming in handy.
Tyradel disarms the trap. This sounds like lockpicking - metal on metal, maybe a bit of a rusty squeal.

TYRADEL There. Should be safe.
There is a pause as they all think about stepping forward.

TYRADEL
Why don’t I go first, just to confirm.
A footstep on tile. A pause.

TYRADEL
You can breathe now. It’s okay.

Me too! I’m not quite ready to see Tyradel on a stick!

That treasure chest wants to eat us - look at its eyes and all of those sharp teeth!

BATS
A mimic! I should have known! They pretend to be treasure chests and long-lost books, and go after any adventurers who dare to come their way!

JUNA
Watch that tongue - see how long it is! It’s going to do some damage to anyone it hits. Get away from there!

BATS
I can’t. I’m stuck to it. I can’t get my hands off of it!

NARRATOR 
You have your blade an instant, swiping long purple tongue.
at the ready in at the beast’s

BATS
It definitely felt that!

JUNA
But I think it might have made it madder. Watch out, it’s trying to bite you!

NARRATOR
The mimic chomps its teeth together, but you pull back just in time and it isn’t able to reach you.

BATS Ha! It missed!

TYRADEL
And while it wasn’t paying attention, I could sneak in from the shadows. Take that!
The sound of two daggers slicing through the air.

BATS
The two of you definitely loosened its grip on me. I think I can maybe just...

A single lute string is plucked. Bats casts Cloud of Daggers against the mimic.

BATS
You want to grab me? This is what you get! A Cloud of Daggers spinning in the air! Get back friends, this will do some damage!

Sound of whirling dagger hits.

JUNA
Look at those daggers fly!

BATS
I’m free now, but it’s coming back for another hit. Can you fend it off, friend?

TYRADEL
I’ll help! Bet you didn’t see this coming, mimic!

NARRATOR
Tyradel steps out of the shadows once again to land a blow, while you send an arrow in the mimic’s direction, hitting it right in the part of its body that still looks like a treasure chest, below the rows of fearsome teeth.

NARRATOR
The creature yelps a little as the flame burns it, and runs, moving quickly in the direction you came from.

BATS
Got ‘em! Ha! It’s running off!

TYRADEL
Now let’s get out of here before it gets the idea to come back!

BATS
Yeah, just give me a moment to catch my breath. I...I can’t believe I didn’t realize that could be a mimic. I know what they are! But in the stories, the heroes always figure it out, without even thinking about it.

JUNA
I love a good story, but you’re a storyteller, don’t you sometimes change things around to make for a better tale?

BATS
You have a point. I just...I thought it would be easier than this, adventuring. All fun and heroics. Not almost getting eaten by treasure.

TYRADEL
The story’s not over yet though, right?

JUNA
And something tells me that by the end of it, we’ll be happy with how everything came out. Come on, let’s go.

With a roar, the treasure chest reveals itself to be a mimic. Sounds of roaring and slobbering and monstrous breathing.

Teeth chomp hard against each other.

TYRADEL 
Missed me!

JUNA
Bats, let me see if I can help you get free. I think Ice Knife ought to do it. Give this mimic a taste of the cold with a sharp shard of ice!

Juna casts Ice Knife. There is the sound of ice shattering against stone and the mimic cries out.

Footsteps as they start to walk out, then a distant slobbering sound.

And I should have known better. Adventurers have been talking about mimics for ages. I can’t believe I almost fell for it.

This part of the tunnel may be a bit boring - stone walls, dirt floor, dirt walls, stone floor - but at least nothing’s trying to skewer us.

TYRADEL 
Or eat us.

JUNA
Maybe we should take advantage of it, rest for a little bit here. Nothing overnight, just a short rest to catch our breaths.

TYRADEL
I could use a moment. Just to sit. I think the last time I rested was when I laid down in the bed before Xanathar grabbed us all.

JUNA
That feels like so long ago. We barely knew each other.

BATS
We still only kinda know each other. Though I do know you’ll be there for me if I need it, and that’s the main thing I care about.

JUNA
Well, we know that I can be clumsy.

TYRADEL
And I deliver mail. Doesn’t sound as exciting in comparison.

BATS
Are you kidding? Look at all you’ve been able to do! Figuring out traps, moving like a shadow.

TYRADEL
I feel like a shadow a lot of the time. Hiding away, not letting anyone see me, just dropping off letters and packages and running off. I say I’m training to be an adventurer, but adventurers are brave and bold.

JUNA
Are you sure that’s what you want?

TYRADEL
I thought it was. It’s why I know so much about the Zhentarim. I thought about maybe joining a group like that, being part of something bigger than me so I could stay in the shadows, but still be seen. Before I realized all the bad stuff they were doing.

BATS
And now you don’t want that?

TYRADEL
I still want to be part of something, but the Zhentarim? No. I could be stuck somewhere in the middle of a cavern alone, instead of with all of you.

JUNA
I know what you mean about seeing things differently. I’m so used to my garden, and having to be so careful, and worrying that my feet are going to trip me up and ruin everything, but here?

BATS
If you do trip, we’ll pick you up.

TYRADEL
And the plants down here seem like they can hold their own.

JUNA Exactly.

Sound of flapping wings.

JUNA 
Did you hear that?

TYRADEL 
Sounded like the wind.

JUNA
No, that’s flapping. Wings flapping. I think we may have caught up to the gold wyrmlings.

BATS
And look, Tyradel, the pendant that Xanathar gave us? It’s starting to glow! Time to stop resting and start moving.

Footsteps as they start up again.

TYRADEL Another fork in the road.

JUNA
And this time there’s nothing blocking either side of it. It’s up to us to decide.

TYRADEL
They look pretty much the same.

JUNA
Almost. Let me squeeze by you and...yup. On the left, the ground is kind of soft and muddy, and on the right, it’s solid stone. Not sure which is better - what do you think?

BATS
And Tyradel, your pendant is glowing the same for each of them?

TYRADEL 
Exactly the same.

We’re just gonna have to choose. Dirt or stone. Quickly, before the glow fades and the wyrmling gets away!

I feel like a shadow a lot of the time. Hiding away, not letting anyone see me, just dropping off letters and packages and running off. I say I’m training to be an adventurer, but adventurers are brave and bold.

JUNA
Are you sure that’s what you want?

TYRADEL
I thought it was. It’s why I know so much about the Zhentarim. I thought about maybe joining a group like that, being part of something bigger than me so I could stay in the shadows, but still be seen. Before I realized all the bad stuff they were doing.

BATS
And now you don’t want that?

TYRADEL
I still want to be part of something, but the Zhentarim? No. I could be stuck somewhere in the middle of a cavern alone, instead of with all of you.

JUNA
I know what you mean about seeing things differently. I’m so used to my garden, and having to be so careful, and worrying that my feet are going to trip me up and ruin everything, but here?

BATS
If you do trip, we’ll pick you up.

TYRADEL
And the plants down here seem like they can hold their own.

JUNA Exactly.

Sound of flapping wings.

JUNA 
Did you hear that?

TYRADEL 
Sounded like the wind.

JUNA
No, that’s flapping. Wings flapping. I think we may have caught up to the gold wyrmlings.

BATS
And look, Tyradel, the pendant that Xanathar gave us? It’s starting to glow! Time to stop resting and start moving.

Footsteps as they start up again.

TYRADEL Another fork in the road.

JUNA
And this time there’s nothing blocking either side of it. It’s up to us to decide.

TYRADEL
They look pretty much the same.

JUNA
Almost. Let me squeeze by you and...yup. On the left, the ground is kind of soft and muddy, and on the right, it’s solid stone. Not sure which is better - what do you think?

BATS
And Tyradel, your pendant is glowing the same for each of them?

TYRADEL 
Exactly the same.

JUNA
We’re just gonna have to choose. Dirt or stone. Quickly, before the glow fades and the wyrmling gets away!

The ground feels a little squishy in this passage. Almost like mud a few hours after the rain.

TYRADEL
Wait. All of you. Stop where you are. There’s more to it than that.

I think something about this passageway is different than it appears to be. I feel exactly like I did in that mosaic room.

JUNA
The one with the traps?

TYRADEL
Exactly. I’m sure there’s a trap here, but I’m not sure where the trigger is. Probably something in this mud waiting for us to step on it.

JUNA
Could we trigger it somehow, so we know what to expect?

BATS
And maybe then you can disarm it, make sure it doesn’t hurt us.

TYRADEL
Great idea. I think the best thing to do would be to throw a few stones, see what happens when they land.

JUNA
(to the listener)
Why don’t you do it? There are stones here on the floor, and I know you’ve got great aim.
Sound of rock hitting the ground.

TYRADEL
Perfect! You hear that? It sounds different than the way the ground sounds over here. Try using a heavier rock.

Sound of rock hitting a fake covering on the ground and plummeting to the surface below (so one softer hit and then a slightly delayed but louder thud).

BATS
A hidden pit. If we’d stepped on that...

JUNA
We would have had quite a ways to fall. Glad you said something, Tyradel!

TYRADEL
Of course. Now we just have to get across the pit.

JUNA
One more Mold Earth spell will do it, I think. I’ll handle it. All I need to do is shift the dirt around a bit and there, we’ve got a walkway, perfect to make it across to that cavern ahead. I think we’re getting closer to finding that Ring!

Juna has a point, and the spell is easy enough to do. At first, nothing really happens. The bit of dirt you’ve touched with the spell moves across the floor with no problem. Until...

Are we sure we want to go this way? I have a bad feeling about this path.

JUNA
I know what you mean. It feels like something’s just very wrong here. Maybe we should double back.

TYRADEL
And lose the chance to get the Ring?

BATS
I know it isn’t what we should do, but the feeling in here is so...

JUNA 
So?

BATS
I was just thinking - stone floor. There could be runes, or magical talismans carved into the ground that cause fear. It’s not real fear we’re feeling, it’s magic fear.

JUNA I believe that.

TYRADEL
So do I. But how do we counteract it? Can we destroy whatever it is?

TYRADEL
Maybe if we find the rune and smash it?

BATS 
We don’t need to.

(starts with the lute)

We have nothing to fear. Calm Emotions will help us stay nice and easy.

Bats casts calm emotions (and possibly plays a calming song on the lute).

JUNA
I do feel calmer. And it looks like you’re walking steadier, friend.

TYRADEL
Me too. A little uneasy still. But better. And the exit’s right there ahead.

It’s not just you. I keep almost tripping, but then bang, the wall is right next to me, keeping me upright. I may have to turn sideways in a moment, and we definitely have to go one at a time.

BATS
(to the Listener)

Why don’t you lead the way? I know you can handle yourself if anything comes up. I just don’t know what we do if it gets much narrower in here.

TYRADEL 
Hold our breath?

A clanging sound.

BATS
What was that? Did you trip over something, friend? Hold on, let me move one of my lights in front of you.

TYRADEL What is it?

BATS
It looks like armor. Old rusty armor.

NARRATOR
But it’s more than that. You’ve seen your share of armor and the way that this armor is arranged seems on purpose, like it’s sending a message of some kind.

BATS
A previous adventurer, probably. Maybe they left it here, or maybe something happened to them, but whatever it was, it was a long time ago.

NARRATOR
It was a long time ago, but these pieces of armor have been moved recently. By the Zhentarim. You nudge Tyradel, next to you, to show him what you’ve found.

TYRADEL
You’re right. There is some sort of message here. It’s like Thieves’ Cant.

BATS
Oh, I’ve heard of that. It’s like a code used by thieves’ to secretly communicate, right?

TYRADEL
Thieves...and the occasional mail carrier.

JUNA
Can you figure out what it says?

TYRADEL
I think so. It’s a sign from the Zhentarim, calling back anyone who’s gone off on their own.

Exactly.

Must be some sort of magical darkness that consumes all light. I can usually see okay in the dark, even if I don’t like it, but right now my darkvision is giving me nothing.

TYRADEL
Same here. This is more than just night time. I can’t help feeling like at any moment, the ground in front of us is going to disappear, and we won’t even know it.

NARRATOR
It is magical darkness. You know the spell. And from what you remember, one of the newest spells you’ve learned in your training should counteract it. Dispel Magic. As you cast it, whatever was causing the darkness fades - it’s still dark, but somehow it feels less all-consuming.

BATS
Much better. Never learned that Dispel Magic spell, but seems like it comes in handy. Now that the shadows are more the regular type, why don’t I light the path forward.

(a strum on the lute)

There, Dancing Lights. Four floating balls of light to help light the way forward. Just like you used back in the fire in Waterdeep.

JUNA

Looks solid enough. I guess we didn’t have to worry. But...are those tracks in the ground?

Maybe, but they have a whole group with them to help them get out of it - a group we may not want to face head-on. We came for the Ring, and that’s where we should be headed.

Another faint shout.

TYRADEL
You’re both making sense. I do think we should try to help whoever needs it, but I’m also ready to get the Ring and get out of this cavern. With all the things we’ve seen in the tunnels so far, I don’t know that we want to lose track of where the Ring might be.

(to Listener) 

Why don’t you decide?

JUNA
Finally. I’m not sad to be done with all those winding tunnels.

BATS
Though we still have two choices for leaving this cavern - left and right.

JUNA
But this time we know where we’re going. The dragon tracks clearly head off to the right.

TYRADEL
The pendant agrees. Look, as I head towards the right, it’s glowing brighter. We just need to --

A shout comes from the left.

JUNA 
What’s that?

TYRADEL
Sounds like shouting. Maybe somebody who needs help?

INT. DRAGON’S HOARD
852 BATS
We’ll only go down this path for a little while - see if anything exciting happens as we turn this corner into -
(gasps)
It’s the Gold Wyrmling! The one we saw on the bridge earlier!
853 TYRADEL
(in a bit of a whisper)
And a lot of gold. And jewels. And who knows what else. I think we’ve found their hoard.
109.
 854 GOLD WYRMLING ASTOTH You have indeed.
(beat)
We dragons have excellent hearing.
855 JUNA
Yes. We mean you no harm, but we have been asked to bring back that Ring to...our employer, and that is what we intend to do. Whatever it takes.
856 TYRADEL
But if we can do it by talking things out, we will. No need to rush into anything.
Astoth chuckles.
857 GOLD WYRMLING ASTOTH
A turn of events from the last time I saw you, when you, Dwarf, had no desire to fight, and you, Elf, were ready to engage. Maybe you are rubbing off on each other.
858 GOLD WYRMLING DRISELLE Stop toying with them, Astoth. We have important things to talk over with them.
859 GOLD WYRMLING ASTOTH Very well Driselle. Adventurers, we have been tracking you as you made your way through this lair, and have been impressed by the way you work together.
860 GOLD WYRMLING DRISELLE Not like those thieves, who all scattered in different directions like scared mice.
861 GOLD WYRMLING ASTOTH
But as we watched you, the thieves were watching us. Somehow, they were able to take the Ring from our possession.
862 GOLD WYRMLING DRISELLE We have...other pressing matters that we must deal with, but maybe you wish to try your hand at taking the Ring from the thieves?
110.

863 GOLD WYRMLING ASTOTH
Or maybe you are also ready to end this quest. We can transport you back to the surface, if you wish, or, if you turn around, you can head in the direction of the thieves and do your best to get the Ring on your own.
864 TYRADEL
Maybe we should go back and report in. There are a lot of them, and just four of us. Our...employer may have some sort of equipment that could help us.
865 JUNA
Like a potion of invisibility.
866 BATS
Or a new spell to add to our arsenal.
867 JUNA
Or we could give it a try. See what we can do. If we get the Ring back, we’ve finished the quest. If we don’t, we can still go back to Xanathar.
868 TYRADEL
Assuming we get away okay. I’ve read a lot about the Zhentarim, and they don’t mess around.
869 BATS
What do you think we should do?
