can you write me a choose your own adventure / fighting fantasy style book with a maximum of 20 passages in harlowe 3.3.8 twee format. 
Each passage must have only 2 choices, apart from the final winning passage which has just one option to go back to the start. 
Storyformat must be harlowe 3.3.8. Can you make the story roughly along the lines of an adventure in ancient greece where the 
you must navigate your way through a dangerous maze, and ultimately defeat a Medusa using a polished shield you find along the way. 
I only want a short version with a maximum of 20 passages please, with descriptive and atmospheric passages.
Is it possible make the passage names more descriptive, e.g. HiddenTrap; and use the [[Choice|Passage]] syntax instead of [[Choice->Passage]]
